        <h2>ZARA</h2>
        <p>Zara stores have men's and women's clothing as well as children's clothing (Zara Kids). Zara Home designs are located in European stores. The majority of Zara customers are aged between 18 and about 35. After products are designed, they take 10 to 15 days to reach the stores.[52] All of the clothing is processed through the distribution center in Spain. New items are inspected, sorted, tagged, and loaded into trucks. In most cases, the clothing is delivered within 48 hours. Zara produces over 450 million items per year.[53]

            Zara also includes accessories, shoes, swimwear, beauty and perfumes.
            
            In May 2021, Zara launched its first beauty line, ZARA Beauty.[54]
            
            Under its Zara Home line, Zara launched what is believed to be the first detergent that reduces the abrasion of textile microfibres during washing. It is claimed the solution, jointly developed by Inditex and BASF Home Care and I&I Solutions Europe in Spain and Germany, can reduce the release of microfibres by up to 80 per cent, depending on fabric type and washing conditions</p>

        <h2>LOUIS VUITTON</h2>
        <p>Louis Vuitton, part of the LVMH group, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate that also owns Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Tiffany, and 75 other brands, is one of the most counterfeited brands in the world. This is mainly due to its iconic designs that have remained relatively unchanged over the 167 years, limited supply, and a strict “NO SALE” policy. Despite the challenges posed by Covid, LV reported increased revenue in Q3 of 2020, thanks to its domination in China, Japan, and Korea – the world’s biggest luxury goods markets. Louis Vuitton has always been trendy, attracting young consumers by diversifying into streetwear and implementing a drop model where collections are released with limited stock and time without prior notice. The brand also uses endorsement deals with the biggest names in Asia, such as Mulan’s Liu Yifei, Squid Game’s Jung Ho-Yeon, tennis player Naomi Osaka, and BTS. 

            Through these strategies, Louis Vuitton continues to remain relevant and popular, especially among younger generations. The brand’s dominance in the luxury goods market is set to continue as it continues to diversify and expand into new markets.</p>

        <h2>GUCCI</h2>
        <p>GUCCI
            Gucci, founded in Florence in 1912, is currently the second most valuable brand in the world. Although Gucci initially focused on manufacturing luxury bags, such as the famous Gucci bamboo bag, canvas suitcase, and The Jackie, they only began making clothing in 1968. Unfortunately, under Maurizio Gucci’s leadership, the brand almost went bankrupt. 
            
            However, in 1994, Tom Ford joined Gucci and transformed the brand into a major player in luxury fashion. The famous ’95 Fall collection and hypersexual brand image gave new meaning to the phrase “Sex sells.” Today, Gucci remains a favorite among Gen Z and millennials, who make up a predicted 40% of the luxury market by 2035. 
            
            Gucci strategically stays at the forefront of pop culture, with everyone from actor Xiao Zhan and K-pop idols IU and Kai to Harry Styles seen sporting the brand. As influencers continue to love logomania, Gucci will continue to dominate the luxury fashion market. </p>

    <h2>PARADA</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1913 by Mario Prada, the brand initially started as a small leather goods store in Milan. However, it wasn’t until the 1980s that Prada became a household name in the fashion world, thanks to Miuccia Prada, Mario’s granddaughter, who took over the family business and transformed it into a global fashion powerhouse.  

        Prada has a strong presence in the luxury retail market with products, including clothing, bags, shoes, and accessories, which are sold through its own stores, as well as through high-end department stores and boutiques. Prada’s ability to create a consistent brand identity and maintain a high level of quality across its product lines has contributed to its success and longevity in the industry.  
        
        In recent years, the brand has made significant efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and promote eco-friendly practices. For example, Prada has launched a sustainable line of nylon products, made from recycled materials, and has implemented energy-saving measures in its stores and factories. </p>

      <h2>HERMES</h2>
      <p>The iconic Hermès brand is known for its luxurious and exclusive bags, such as the famous Birkin and Kelly bags. These bags have become a status symbol, with their resale value being 10 times that of gold, and their acquisition considered a sign of having “made it.” Hermès employs unique marketing tactics to maintain its prestige, such as word-of-mouth and exclusivity, as well as naming bags after famous celebrities like Grace Kelly and Jane Birkin.  

        The brand limits the production of these bags and keeps the numbers crafted each year a closely guarded secret, creating an air of scarcity around their products. Hermès uses its heritage and family heirloom mentality to build a sense of tradition and exclusivity around their bags, and their customers are more likely to be offered the chance to purchase a Birkin based on their past purchases of Hermès couture, collections, and accessories. 
        
        In addition, Hermès has also been experimenting with new-age materials. Hermès recently teamed up with a company called MycoWorks, which specializes in creating sustainable and eco-friendly leather alternatives from mushrooms. This innovative new material is not only environmentally friendly, but it also has a unique texture and appearance that sets it apart from traditional leather. Hermès has used this material in a limited-edition handbag collection, demonstrating their commitment to innovation and sustainability while still maintaining the luxury and exclusivity that their brand is known for.</p>

The brand was founded in Rome in 1884 by Sotirios Voulgaris, a Greek silversmith who moved to Italy.

      <h2>ALEXANDER MCQUEEN</h2>
      <p>Alexander McQueen, the namesake of the fashion house, was known for his dark and edgy designs that incorporated unconventional materials and techniques. McQueen’s designs challenged the traditional boundaries of fashion and were often inspired by his personal experiences and cultural references. 

        One of McQueen’s most famous collections was his “Highland Rape” collection, which was criticized for its controversial name and graphic depictions of violence against women. However, the collection also brought attention to issues of gender and power dynamics in fashion and society. 
        
        After McQueen’s untimely death in 2010, Sarah Burton took over as creative director of the fashion house. Under her leadership, the brand has continued to innovate and push boundaries, while still staying true to McQueen’s legacy. 
        
        Burton has designed many memorable pieces for the brand, including the dress worn by Catherine Middleton (now the Duchess of Cambridge) at her wedding to Prince William in 2011. The intricate lace and satin gown were hailed as a modern classic and cemented Burton’s place as one of the top designers in the fashion industry. 
        
        The Alexander McQueen brand is also known for its collaborations with artists and designers from other fields. For example, the brand has collaborated with Damien Hirst, who created a unique skull print for the brand’s scarves and accessories. These collaborations have helped the brand stay relevant and cutting-edge in an ever-changing fashion landscape.</p>
